## About the Project

This Java-based project automates the login process for Facebook Messenger using Selenium WebDriver. The automation script reads user credentials from a `UserLogin.txt` file, which must be placed in the root directory of the project.

### `UserLogin.txt` File

- **First Line:** Your Facebook email address or phone number.
- **Second Line:** Your Facebook password.

The script uses these credentials to log in to Messenger, enabling further automated interactions. Ensure the `UserLogin.txt` file is kept secure and is not included in version control.
